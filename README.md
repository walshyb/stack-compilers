# Stack Compilers
The stages for a compiler I am building for Anthony Dos Reis's Assembler for SUNY New Paltz's Language Processing class.

## S1
Includes support for addition, multiplication, print line (println) statements, and expressions in parentheses.

## S2
Includes support for subtraction, division, the null statement (;), compound statements (AKA blocks: {} ), print statements, and single-line comments.

## S3
Includes support for println with 0 arguments, println and print with string arguments, cascaded assignment statements, unary plus and minus operations, and readint statements (read integers from keyboard).

## S3 (By Dos Reis)
Same as result as mine, but by Dos Reis!

## S4
Includes support for while, do-while, if, and if-else statements, escape characters, string constants that span multiple lines. 

Does **not** include range checking on integer constants nor error recovery.
